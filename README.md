      <strong>Published in 1994</strong> in the book <strong>Design Patterns:
      Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</strong>, it is a set
      of reusable solutions to recurring problems in <strong>software
      development</strong>, applicable across different programming
      languages. These are high-level concepts used to address
      <strong>specific situations</strong>.

         <strong>Creational:</strong> These patterns focus on <strong>how objects are
         created</strong>, abstracting the process to make the code more <strong>
         flexible and reusable</strong>, while hiding the implementation and
         easing adaptation to changes. They centralize object creation
         logic to improve consistency. They also support lazy
         initialization, reducing unnecessary
         resource usage.

         <strong>Structural:</strong> These pattern organize <strong>how objects and
         classes relate</strong> to form larger structures, making it easier to
         use and <strong>reuse existing components instead of rewriting
         </strong> everything from scratch. It also allows components
         to be adapted or combined flexibly for different contexts.
         This approach reduces complexity and improves 
         maintainability in software design.
